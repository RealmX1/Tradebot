long profit pct is much higher; might need to lower threshold to increase trade rate and decrease profit pct to make it comparable to no weight.
ALSO: should start consider tracking "HOLD TIME". How much percent of time is a stock being held on to -- as un utilized time can be used to buy other stocks.
